Abstract:
Animal life and the environment have a profound impact on human disease. With environmental and climate change,
animal and vector habitats are constantly changing which presents a unique challenge in the diagnosis of zoonosis
and vector-borne diseases. Our project seeks to shift thinking about epidemiology to a dynamic rather than static
entity and then to equip clinicians with a clinical decision support system for this. We propose the tool, DynaEpi, that
uses data on animal and vector habitat change to display a dynamic disease risk area on a geographic map. This tool
will assist clinicians in recognizing potentially emergent zoonotic disease threats.

Supplementary materials for the proposal paper: Dynamic_Epidemiology_SUPP.pdf
Supplementary materials for the SDC proposal include a link to the prototype, UI design interview questions for 
   clinicians who volunteered their time as well as a list of the clinicians who participated.
   The Dynamic Epidemiology SDC was focused on an effecitve and acceptable user-interface (UI) and information 
   presentation, as such, the bulk of the time for the design challenge was spent in an iterative design process.

Poster presented at the 2019 AMIA Annual Symposium in Washington DC is Dynamic_Epidemiology_poster.pdf
   * Note on poster: Poster presented at symposium had an unfortunate error indicating the CDC reference that 1 in 6 
   diseases is transmitted between people and animals. The correct estimated rate is 6 in 10 diseases are transmitted
   between people and animals. We regret our error and have corrected it on the digital copy for future prints.
